# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Hey I made this using Vite+React basically its a coding contest round for my college IT dept event & the reason is the name of the app is Blind Coding cause in the editor where you write code You can't see what
you written & after submit the code your code will compile then youn will see your output & code what you written
here I used 'piston api' for compilation basically its free to use 

The app link -> [blind-coding-iota.vercel.app](https://blind-coding-iota.vercel.app/)
